# Legend_of_Wesmere

This is a port of the 1.6 version of _Legends of Wesmere_ SP campaign for the [Battle for Wesnoth](https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth) TBS game.

If you do like the current hybrid and pathetically bad setup of the current mainline LoW, try this. This is what LoW used to be like.

Please note:

1. That contributions are appreciated as the porting process might not have been too thorough.
2. If think campaign is too hard, make a fourth easier difficulty and not dilute the existing ones.
